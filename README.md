Vanilla Javascript - shopping cart

Setup instructions and steps:

This is written by Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, LocalStorage and array object) to create a shopping cart for PhonesMart to sell phones online. A special PhonesMart logo is created. 
This shop has two html, two JavaScript and one CSS files. 

Index.html file works with main.js:
•	To create a landing page with all the products’ details using data stored in an array object.
•	Display how many items are in the cart and a total price for all items.
•	Each item is displayed in a card format and styled with CSS.
•	Each item can be added or removed from the cart. Total number of items and total price will be updated accordingly as well as in the local storage.
•	A checkout button is available for showing details of the cart before proceeding for payment.

Once customer clicks on the checkout button:
•	cart.js will grab all the cart details from the local storage and populate data via cart.html. 
•	A table will be created with a total price and styled with CSS.
•	Customer can decide to click on a button to process payment (not require for implementation) or change of mind to continue shopping (return to index.html).
•	Data will be kept in the local storage.
